  <h1>Sales Prediction Project</h1>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This project focuses on predicting sales based on advertising data using machine learning techniques.</p>
  
  <h2>Dataset</h2>
  <p>The dataset used in this project is "Advertising.csv" which contains information about advertising expenditure on TV, Radio, and Newspaper, along with corresponding sales figures.</p>
  
  <h2>Code Overview</h2>
  <p>The project involves the following steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Loading the dataset and performing initial data exploration.</li>
    <li>Performing data preprocessing and visualization, including histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots.</li>
    <li>Calculating various statistics such as mean, sum, and difference between columns.</li>
    <li>Training a linear regression model to predict sales.</li>
    <li>Evaluating the model using RMSE and examining feature importance.</li>
    <li>Performing residual analysis to assess model performance.</li>
    <li>Predicting sales for new data.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>The analysis and modeling results indicate a significant impact of TV advertising on sales, followed by radio and newspaper advertising. The linear regression model achieves a certain level of accuracy in predicting sales based on advertising expenditures.</p>
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict sales based on advertising data. The results can assist businesses in making informed decisions regarding advertising budgets and strategies.</p>
